This process is to use Window Task Schedular to run automate running those SAS code (even during weekend or midnight !)

How to Schedule Tasks:


Before Scheduling :
  1. Create a SASScratch Folder inside SAS folder (Eg: C:\Program Files\SASHome94\SASScratch ) 

  2. Create three subfolder inside the SASSratch folder:
      a) SAS Batch 
          - dont open with double click, open by right click and edit with notepad
          - a bat file that with a line that consist 4 componenets: 
              -1) Path to your SAS system (.exe)
              -2) Path to your SAS configuration file (.cfg)
              -3) path to your SAS code file (.sas)
              -4) path to save the log file (.log)
          -Eg: "path_for_your_SAS.exe"-CONFIG "path_for_your_saq_cfg_file" -sysin "path_to_your_code_for_scheduling_run.sas" -LOG "path_to_save_the_log_when_running_report.log"
          -If want to run different code using a SAS Batch File : create multiple line 
    
      b) SAS Code 
          - place to save the SAS code to scheduling
          - Instead of putting the original sas code file, to create another sas code file to excecute the original sas code file using function %include :
                -Eg:  %include "\Users\&sysuserid.\autoexc.sas";
                      %include "SAS_code.sas"
                      proc printto; run;
                      endsas;
          -To add a line to proc Printto log = "log\.log" new; run; so that it will save the run log in the SAS log after running 
  
      c) SAS Log   
          - Folder path when SAS will save the log after or during running the code 
          - to add the log path in the SAS Batch File

TO Scheduling :
  1. Open Window Task Schedular
  2. Click Task Schedular Library on the left side 
  3. GO to Action (right side), select Create Task 
  4. Name the Task (Eg:Report_Name)
  5. Add new /Edit the Trigger ( Daily/Monthly/Weekly, Start Time, and other advanced settings based on your requirement)
  6. Go to Actions, New, Start a program and browse and select the Batch File that created then OK

Then the window task Schedular will run the task based on the setting 

Notes : 
you can manual run by clicking the task name and click Run on the right panel
making sure you have set all the access required in your SAS code such as autoexec file (including your system user name and Password)
