/*When Exporting Large Dataset into local server, we could choose to use either :

i) Proc Statement :

  libname output "local_drive_location";
  rsubmit;
  Proc Download data=base
  out=output.base;
  run;
  endrsubmit;


or 

ii) using Data statemnet :

  Data output.base;
  set base;
  run;

/* Overall, proc download would be faster than data steps as data steps read each line and proc download or even proc copy can move the data in blocks*/
