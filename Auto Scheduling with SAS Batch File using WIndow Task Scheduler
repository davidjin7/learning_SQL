  Executing the Job Immediately In Windows Explorer
Right-click on the SAS program you want to submit.
For SAS® 9.3: From the pop-up menu, select Batch Submit for SAS® 9.3.
For SAS® 9.4: From the pop-up menu, choose Batch Submit for SAS® 9.4.
This SAS program file should have a .sas extension.
After execution, the program Output (.lst) and Log (.log)files will be located in the same folder as your .sas program.  
2.  Scheduling a SAS Batch Job to Run at a Specific Time
This method uses the Windows Task Scheduler to schedule a time and date for the batch job to be executed.

For Windows 7:

A batch file is a file which can be used to execute jobs in Windows.
It can be used to run one or many SAS jobs.
It needs to include both:
The path of your SAS software (sas.exe) on your computer
The path to the location of the SAS program you wish to execute.
It should contain a line for each SAS program you want to execute using Windows Scheduler.

Step 1.  Create a batch file (which has a .bat extension)
  
Go to the Windows Start Menu -> All Programs -> Accessories->  Notepad
Type on one line:  
   1. The path of the SAS software (with quotes around the path)
   2. – SYSIN
   3. The path of the SAS program which you want to execute using Windows Scheduler.  
Save the batch file as .BAT type file.
The batch file content to run a SAS program called SASProg1.sas using SAS 9.3 will look like this:
    "C:\Program Files\SASHome\SASFoundation\9.3"  -SYSIN  “C:\myprogs\SASProg1.sas” 

The path of SAS software can be different for different installations. 
The above path is the default location where SAS 9.3 installs.
Default path for SAS 9.2: "C:\Program Files\SAS9.2\SASFoundation\9.2\sas.exe"
To submit multiple SAS programs in batch mode, the batch file will have one row like above for each of your SAS programs you wish to execute in batch mode (changing the path to the location of each program).  For example, the batch file content to run two SAS programs called SASProg1.sas and SASProg2.sas using SAS 9.3 will look like this:
                        "C:\Program Files\SASHome\SASFoundation\9.3"  -SYSIN  “C:\myprogs\SASProg1.sas” 
                        "C:\Program Files\SASHome\SASFoundation\9.3"  -SYSIN  “C:\myprogs\SASProg2.sas”

 Step 2:
Go to the Windows Start Menu -> All Programs -> Accessories -> System Tools -> Task Scheduler
Double-Click on Create Basic Task
This brings up the Create BasicTask Wizard.
